# AirBnB-NYC-Visualization-Project
A visualization project to understand the Airbnb market in NYC using Shiny app to deploy a web interactive dashboard. The project is hosted in https://danellen.shinyapps.io/airbnb-nyc-2019-visualization-project/ . Please refer to the About section in the dashboard for more information about the scope of the project. 
I will aim to not only create a model that predicts well, but also allow myself to describe data insights drawn from exploration.
